A basic clone of a popular micro-messaging social network.

Things implemented beyond the scope of the task:

- Working hashtags on the tweets (consumed far too much time!)


Things that I am really bad at and need to improve on:

- CSS: I find this very fiddly and difficult


Things that I need clarification on:
- Testing and adding additional things in later (e.g. Username). How do you modify tests effectively as your project evolves?
- How to login with either a username of password


Things that I need to implement:
- Lost password authentication
